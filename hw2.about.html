        <p><h2>Hi, I'm Shaked! </h2><br> 25 years old from Kfar Yona.<br> I am a
          personal and group fitness trainer specializing in weight loss, body
          sculpting and muscle building for over 7 years.<br> I also provide
          nutritional guidance and specialize in functional training, strength
          training, <br>kickboxing, Pilates, spinning, Trx, Surfset and have
          certification for Kangoo Jump training certification.

          <h3> A little about me:</h3>
          My fitness journey started at the age of 15 when I realized that I
          wanted to move beyond dance.<br> I felt that dancing did not provide
          me with the health and physical benefits I wanted. <br>I started
          working out in gyms and training studios, fell in love with it, lost
          weight,<br> got stronger, gained confidence and developed a love for
          my body. This journey allowed me to discover more about myself.

          <h3>How I started:</h3>
          I started training while serving as a combat fitness instructor in the
          Southern Command and later in the air force's recreational unit.<br> I
          did different and amazing training there including trampoline,
          kickboxing, spinning, pilates, Zumba and more.<br> During and after
          the service I decided to turn my passion for fitness into a
          profession. <br>I love coaching people, teaching them to love exercise
          and helping them make their lives the best they can be.

          <h3>I invite you to join me on this fitness journey <br>and experience
            the amazing change it can bring about in your life.<br> Come train
            with me and enjoy the satisfaction of an active lifestyle!</h3>

          <br>
          <h3> So what are you waiting for? <br></h3>
